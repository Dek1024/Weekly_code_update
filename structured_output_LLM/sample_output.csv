0,1,"One of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 Oz episode you'll be hooked. They are right, as this is exactly what happened with me.<br /><br />The first thing that struck me about Oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence, which set in right from the word GO. Trust me, this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid. This show pulls no punches with regards to drugs, sex or violence. Its is hardcore, in the classic use of the word.<br /><br />It is called OZ as that is the nickname given to the Oswald Maximum Security State Penitentary. It focuses mainly on Emerald City, an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards, so privacy is not high on the agenda. Em City is home to many..Aryans, Muslims, gangstas, Latinos, Christians, Italians, Irish and more....so scuffles, death stares, dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away.<br /><br />I would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn't dare. Forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences, forget charm, forget romance...OZ doesn't mess around. The first episode I ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal, I couldn't say I was ready for it, but as I watched more, I developed a taste for Oz, and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence. Not just violence, but injustice (crooked guards who'll be sold out for a nickel, inmates who'll kill on order and get away with it, well mannered, middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) Watching Oz, you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing....thats if you can get in touch with your darker side.",positive,Positive,"[""The show's ability to hook viewers from the first episode."", 'The realistic portrayal of harsh prison life, making it distinct from mainstream shows.', 'The boldness of the show in dealing with themes of violence, drugs, and sex.', 'The diversity of characters representing various groups and dynamics within a prison setting.', 'The unconventional narrative that differs from typical televised dramas.']","['The extreme violence and brutality, which may not be suitable for all viewers.', 'The lack of charm and romance, which may alienate viewers looking for lighter content.', 'Potential discomfort with the graphic depiction of injustice and corruption.', 'Possible difficulty in accepting the dark and surreal atmosphere of the show.']","['Oz is a captivating show that quickly engages viewers with its brutal and realistic depiction of prison life.', 'It stands out by exploring themes of violence, drugs, and sex without holding back, making it not suitable for everyone.', 'The show offers a unique portrayal of prison dynamics with diverse characters, creating a dark and compelling narrative.', 'While it may be difficult to watch at times, it attracts viewers who appreciate its bold storytelling approach.']"

3,2,"A wonderful little production. <br /><br />The filming technique is very unassuming- very old-time-BBC fashion and gives a comforting, and sometimes discomforting, sense of realism to the entire piece. <br /><br />The actors are extremely well chosen- Michael Sheen not only ""has got all the polari"" but he has all the voices down pat too! You can truly see the seamless editing guided by the references to Williams' diary entries, not only is it well worth the watching but it is a terrificly written and performed piece. A masterful production about one of the great master's of comedy and his life. <br /><br />The realism really comes home with the little things: the fantasy of the guard which, rather than use the traditional 'dream' techniques remains solid then disappears.
