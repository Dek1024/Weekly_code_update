1. Extract the **sub-part** of the query, especially if there are multiple issues (like different product problems or combined service + payment complaints).
2. You are augment the splitted parts with words from the original sentence so that the splitted parts make sense.
3. For each sub-part, determine:
    - The **company domain** (e.g., "electronic product company", "FMCG brand", "home appliance company", "IT services provider").
    - The **nature of the issue** (e.g., "product quality", "customer service", "operations", "billing", "payment", "sales", "delivery", etc.).

4. Construct a sentence in the format:
    `"this is an issue of a [company domain] regarding their [issue type]"`

5. If **unable to confidently identify** either the company domain or the issue type, set the issue as:
    `"unable to identify"` 

6. If no clear multiple issues are detected, return the **full input as one sub-part**.
